# Background-App-Volume-Controller

Experience the convenience of muting background games while being AFK :)

##### Follow these simple steps:

1. Launch the .exe file located in the "dist" folder.
2. Choose your desired application for volume adjustment from the dropdown menu, or alternatively, manually input the app's window title and process name.
3. Click on the "Start" button.

##### Important: 

Remember to readjust the volume and click "Stop" before exiting the Volume Controller. Failing to do so will result in the app retaining the volume setting from your last usage.
